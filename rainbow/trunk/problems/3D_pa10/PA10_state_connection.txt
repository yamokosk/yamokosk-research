% This GPOPS License is based on the Simple Public License.  In    %
% the same spirit as the Simple Public License, the language       %
% implementation the GPOPS License is similar to that of GPL 2.0.  %
% The words are different, but the goal is the same - to guarantee %
% for all users the freedom to share and change software.  If      %
% anyone wonders about the meaning of the GPOPS License, they      %
% should interpret it as consistent with GPL 2.0.                  %
%                                                                  %

%       recover direct damages up to the amount you paid for it    %
%       (that is zero if you did not pay anything). You may not    %
%       recover any other damages, including those called          %
%       "consequential damages." (The state or country where you   %
%       live may not allow you to limit your liability in this     %
%       way, so this may not apply to you);                        %

% The GPOPS License continues perpetually, except that your        %

%     * You do not abide by the "give back to the community" terms %
%       (your licensees get to keep their rights if they abide);   %
%     * Anyone prevents you from distributing the software under   %
%       the terms of the SimPL.                                    %
