Background

\begin_layout Standard
Human friendly robots in the health care environment are expected to augment
 current human capabilites [minimially invasive surgeries], assist with
 rehabilitation tasks 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Jezernik2003,Hesse2000}

\end_inset

, and automate mundane yet critical tasks [perscription filling].
 Specific instances of these systems are already operational [DaVinci, etc]
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Jezernik2003}

\end_inset

 and many more exist as prototypes in research labs across the world [research
 examples, unpublished GatorRay paper].
 However, despite the success of these early systems, they typically lack
 any significant level of autonomy.
 To ensure patient and operator safety, these systems are usually just sophistic
ated mechanical extensions of the operator.
 Furthermore, automatic fault or anomoly detection is primarily concerned
 with the hardware anomolys (e.g.
 a corrupt sensor or failed brake circuit).
 More global faults, such as unplanned collisions with a person or the environme
nt are the responsibility of the operator.
 Addressing these and other shortcomings of human-friendly robots is the
 subject current research.
 The aims of this project are focused on developing safe, autonomous motion
 planning algorithms as well as better fault detection algorithms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The motion planning problem, has received a lot of attention over the years.
 Its is concerned with finding algorithms which provide robots the ability
 to plan their own movements given a few conditions or constraints by the
 user.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Safer robots means they can be operated in close proximity Operating under
 the assumption that collisions between robot and human are inevatable,
 a community of researchers have sought through mechanical design to make
 such it impossible for a robot to harm a person.
 While proposals have varied, in general these designs share the same set
 of characteristics including, constructed from light weight materials,
 actuated by low maximum torque/velocity actuators, or constructed of flexible
 or compliant links and joints.
 These designs are well conceived, but often the resultant robot becomes
 too weak or inaccurate to perform any real task.
 A second problem is that currently these human-friendly designs are not
 mass produced like their industrial counterparts.
 Therefore, they are more expensive and more difficult to obtain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many outstanding problems yet to be solved before truly human-friendly
 robotson the road to complete autonomous systems.
 One in particular, known as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Traditional methods to ensure the safety of robot users are derived from
 industrial guidelines set forth by the Robotics Industries Association
 (RIA).
 The RIA, the only trade group in North America organized specifically to
 serve the robotics industry, recommends safety standards by which to install
 and operate robotic systems.
 These recommendations, which include measures such as cages, light curtains,
 and pressure pads, ensure safety by isolating the robot from humans during
 autonomous operation.
 Such measures are too conservative for use in a medical setting where the
 robot's close proximity to humans is dicated by the application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Global planners are nice because a solution is found if one exists.
 The bad is that they are computationally intensive.
 The robot's interaction with the environment and its ability to react intellige
ntly to human movement is dictated by the slowest module of the control
 and planning system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Local planning algorithms are computationally efficient but can become stuck
 or fail to complete the original performance objective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Global or exact methodologies are guaranteed to find a solution to the motion
 planning problem if one exists.
 Usually these methods attempt to explicitly represent the free configuration
 space of the manipulator system.
 First introduced by Lozano-Pérez 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Lozano-Perez1983a}

\end_inset

, the configuration space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}$
\end_inset

 abstracts the motion planning problem by encoding the robot's 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 degree of freedom as independent parameters of an 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-dimensional manifold.
 The free configuration space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}_{free}$
\end_inset

 is simply the subset 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}_{free}\subseteq\mathcal{C}$
\end_inset

 which is void of any obstacles lifted into
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}$
\end_inset

.
 However, they have several disadvantages.
 The algorithms necessary for global methods are computationally intensive.
 Also, the computational cost increases quickly as a function of the degree
 of freedom of the system in question.
 In fact, the theoretical complexity of exact methods is exponential in
 the number of degrees of freedom of the robot, making these methods intractable
 for real-time planning or collision avoidance 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{de2000-Computational}

\end_inset

.
 The alternative is vast number of local or approximate methods {ref}.
 These are less computationally demanding and have been integrated into
 a real-time robotic control system {ref}.
 However, what makes these methods computationally efficient also becomes
 their main disadvantage: unlike exact or global methods, these can not
 guarantee to find a solution if one exists.
 Examples of seemingly simple yet practical workspaces can be constructed
 to demonstrate where each local method can fail {ref}.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite this major shortcoming, local and approximate methods have thus
 far provided the best answer to real-time planning and control.
 Is it impractical to demand optimal or exact solutions from a real-time
 system? It depends on the time scale involved.
 Consider a chess playing robot such as Deep Blue.
 Each turn it must formulate an action or plan based on the current positions
 of the pieces on the chess board.
 The game-tree complexity of chess is now evaluated at approximately 10123.
 (As a comparison, the number of atoms in the Universe is estimated to be
 between 4x1079 and 1081.) Computing an optimal series of actions, which
 equates to finding an optimal path in this tree, is simply not possible.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A slightly different approach has sought to make commercially available
 robots more safe through intelligent software control.
 Several algorithms have seen partial success.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Artificial potential field (APF) techniques attempt to address the planning
 and control problems simultaneously.
 Obstacles and a goal location are assigned user designed repulsive and
 attractive potentials, respectively.
 A virtual control force, normally applied to the manipulator's end-effector,
 is generated by summing the negative gradient of each potential field.
 By following the negative gradient of each field, the end-effector will
 be repulsed from obstacles and attracted towards the goal location.
 Placed in a discrete control system, the composite potential field can
 be updated in every control cycle to account for not only static but also
 dynamic obstacles and yields real-time collision avoidance and regulation
 behavior.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Naive construction of the potential field functions can lead to local minima.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Local minima problem has been heavily investigated and a few good solutions
 have been proposed.
 But are these solutions applicable to real-time implementation? To real
 world environments? 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
APF techniques also does not immediately consider the limitations of the
 robotic system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Moving on from the local minima problem, APF methods only address the pre-collis
ion problem.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In the past decade, great advances have been made in the control of non-linear
 systems through the application of Lyapunov design techniques.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Some of these advances have been made by co-investigator Dixon (preliminary
 results?)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Preliminary investigations by other research groups have laid the initial
 ground work for this approach and prove its feasability.

Placed in a discrete control system, the composite potential field can be
 updated in every control cycle to account for not only static but also
 dynamic obstacles and yields real-time collision avoidance and regulation
 behavior.
 APF methods can be better understood as a subset of impedance control or
 more generally, force control.
 Conventional impedance control is a well studied techique for controlling
 the response a manipulator to an external force normally generated from
 contact with the environment.
 APF methods substitute the external forces associated with contact forces
 for those generated by the virtual potential.
\end_layout

Khatib was the first to propose APFs as a technique to achieve real-time
 collision avoidance 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Khatib1986-90}

\end_inset

.
 While his contribution was significant, it also revealed the primary drawback
 of all APF techniques.
 Naive constuction of the function defining the potential fields can lead
 to the creation of local minima in the workspace of the robot.
 Local minima are created when the virtual forces cancel each other.
 If a local minima occurs on the path of the end effector, its motion will
 terminate since the net force on the end effector will be zero and the
 arm will not reache the goal location.
 Significant effort has been devoted to the elimination of local minima.
 A small sampling of this work reveals a large variety of the approaches
 that have been attempted.
 These include backtracking, random walks 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Barraquand1990}

\end_inset

, switching between points on the robot to calculate and apply the control
 effort 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Chang1996}

\end_inset

, behaviour/agent based approaches 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Hamilton1998}

\end_inset

, fuzzy logic 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Mbede2003-249,Merchan-Cruz2006}

\end_inset

, sliding mode control 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Cardiel2004}

\end_inset

, better potential functions 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Connolly1993-931,Volpe1990-1423,Cardiel2004,Tanner2003}

\end_inset

.
 Some of these works deserve further discussion.
 Of primary interest in this research is the work done by Mbede et al.
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Mbede2003-249}

\end_inset

.
 Before their work, few attempts were made to apply modern non-linear control
 design techniques to APF-based or even impedance controllers.
 By applying recently developed Lyapunov design techniques, Mbede et al.
 designed a uniformly, ultimately bounded regulator using a fuzzy rule system
 to reason about the APF output.
 They combined this with a neural network to deal with any other dynamic
 model uncertainties.
 By employing Lyapunov stability analysis, Galicki developed a trajectory
 generator which obeyed dynamic constraints of the manipulator and kept
 the manipulator away from dynamic obstacle through the use of an external
 penalty function 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Galicki2004}

\end_inset

.
 Despite claims as a real-time method, his algorithm relied on a priori
 knowledge of the obstacles locations in the worksapce.

\begin_layout Standard
To realize this promise, advances in robotics technology must reach several
 milestones including: Given the increasing adoption of robotics technology
 in health care, is there reason for concern? There are in fact, two important
 reasons.
 The first reason is that, with few exceptions, most research focus on either
 the complexity of the environment (and assume that the robots have trivial
 dynamics or kinematics) or on the detailed robot dynamics (while assuming
 trivial environments).
 Motion planning for a manipulator system in close proximity to humans requires
 both a detailed robot model as well as a complex environment.

Significance

\begin_layout Standard
To fight soaring health care costs and simultaneously increase the quality
 of health care, many researchers are turning to the technologies of robotics
 and intelligent systems to find solutions.
 Over the last decade, there has been an explosion of robotic applications
 in health services ranging from advanced surgery, such as image-guided
 surgery, minimal invasive surgery, and telesurgery, to a variety of home
 healthcare services, including remote health monitoring, telenursing, mobility
 assistance and rehabilitation.
 The Food and Drug Administration, who reviews data on the safety and effectiven
ess of robotic software and hardware, estimates that 36,600 robotic surgeries
 were done in 2005, up nearly 50 percent from 2004.
 Analysts predict the figure will grow at a similar rate in the coming months
 as the general public becomes informed about the advantages of robotically
 assissted surgeries.
 Similarly, robotics technology is becoming more popular in rehabilitation
 and assissted living.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The impact of robotics technology on health care costs and quality are still
 debatable.
 To fully realize the potential of robotics technology, advances in the
 robotics disciplines must achieve several milestones including: 1) new
 robotic control systems to allow the development of a robotic system that
 performs clinically relevant tasks while interacting in a safe manner with
 the patient (
