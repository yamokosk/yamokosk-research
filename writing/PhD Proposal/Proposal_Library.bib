	controller derived from modeling error compensation ideas and singular
	perturbation theory, that requires a minimum knowledge of the plant
	(i.e., constant estimate of the inertia matrix). It is shown that
	semiglobal practical stabilization is achieved; that is, given any
	compact set of initial velocity field errors, there exist PI control
	gains which guarantee that the robot tracks a desired velocity field
	with arbitrary accuracy. The proposed controller was experimentally
	evaluated on a two degrees-of-freedom arm.},

	controller that makes a mechanical system track reference curves
	in a potential field. Contrary to conventional reference tracking,
	we do not specify a single time-varying trajectory that the system
	has to track. Instead, we specify a whole curve that the system
	has to stay on at all times. Using tools from differential geometry,
	we first derive a controller that makes the system move along arbitrary
	(smooth enough) reference curves while keeping the kinetic energy
	constant. We then apply the results to the case of movement in an
	artificial potential field, in which case, the reference curves
	are completely determined by the potential field and cannot be chosen
	arbitrarily. Simulation then shows the performance of the controller
	on a benchmark robot with two degrees of freedom.},

  abstract = {We propose a passive bilateral teleoperation control law for a pair
	of n-degree-of-freedom (DOF) nonlinear robotic systems. The control
	law ensures energetic passivity of the closed-loop teleoperator
	with power scaling, coordinates motions of the master and slave
	robots, and installs useful task-specific dynamics for inertia scaling,
	motion guidance, and obstacle avoidance. Consequently, the closed-loop
	teleoperator behaves like a common passive mechanical tool. A key
	innovation is the passive decomposition, which decomposes the 2n-DOF
	nonlinear teleoperator dynamics into two robot-like systems without
	violating passivity: an n-DOF shape system representing the master-slave
	position coordination aspect, and an n-DOF locked system representing
	the dynamics of the coordinated teleoperator. The master-slave position
	coordination is then achieved by regulating the shape system, while
	programmable apparent inertia of the coordinated teleoperator is
	achieved by scaling the inertia of the locked system. To achieve
	this perfect coordination and inertia scaling, the proposed control
	law measures and compensates for environment and human forcing.
	Passive velocity field control and artificial potential field control
	are used to implement guidance and obstacle avoidance for the coordinated
	teleoperator. The designed control is also implemented in an intrinsically
	passive negative semidefinite structure to ensure energetic passivity
	of the closed-loop teleoperator, even in the presence of parametric
	model uncertainties and inaccurate force sensing. Experiments are
	performed to validate the properties of the proposed control framework.},

  volume = {46},
  pages = {1360 - 1371},
  number = {9},
  abstract = {In contour following applications, the various degrees of freedom
	of a mechanical system have to be well coordinated, but very often,
	the speed at which the contour is followed is not critical. Moreover,
	in the context of machining, the system has to interact closely
	with its physical environment. When the contour following task is
	represented by a velocity field on the configuration manifold of
	the system, the coordination aspect of the problem is made explicit.
	The passive velocity field control (PVFC) scheme developed in the
	Part I companion paper [7] can then be applied to track the defined
	velocity field so that the desired contour is followed, and to ensure
	that the interaction of the closed-loop system with the physical
	environment is passive to enhance safety and stability. Unfortunately,
	for some contours, an encoding velocity field on the configuration
	manifold does not exist or is difficult to define and, as a consequence,
	the PVFC cannot be directly applied. For systems whose configuration
	manifolds are compact Lie groups and the desired contour is represented
	by a parameterized trajectory, a general methodology is developed,
	using a suspension technique, to define a velocity field on a manifold
	related to the configuration manifold of the system for which PVFC
	can be applied. With this strategy, timing along the contour can
	be naturally varied on-line by a self-pacing scheme so that the
	contour tracking performance can be improved. The experimental results
	for a 2 degree of freedom robot following a Lissajous contour illustrates
	and verifies the convergence and robustness properties of the PVFC
	methodology.},

	its physical environment. Based on these two concepts, a new passive
	velocity field controller (PVFC) is proposed which mimics the behavior
	of a passive energy storage element, such as a flywheel or a spring.
	It stores and releases energy while interacting with the manipulator,
	but does not generate any, The controller has the interesting property
	that it stabilizes any multiple (positive or negative) of the desired
	velocity held, and exponentially stabilizes the particular multiple
	of the desired velocity field which is determined by the total kinetic
	energy of the manipulator control system.},

  abstract = {This is the first part of a two-part paper on the design of intelligent
	controllers for a class of exercise machines. Tbe control objective
	is to cause the user to exercise in a manner which optimizes a criterion
	related to the user's mechanical power. The optimal exercise strategy
	is determined by a biomechanical behavior of the individual user,
	which is assumed to satisfy an affine force-velocity relationship
	dependent on the body geometric configuration, Consequently, the
	control scheme must simultaneously: 1) identify the user's biomechanical
	behavior; 2) optimize the controller; and 3) stabilize the system
	to the estimated optimal states, Moreover, to ensure that the exercise
	machine is safe to operate, the control system guarantees that the
	interaction between the exercise machine and the user is passive.
	In this first part of the paper, we formulate the control problem
	and propose a controller structure which satisfies the safety requirement
	and is capable of causing the user to execute an arbitrary exercise
	strategy if the user's biomechanical behavior is known, The controller
	is of the form of a dynamic damper and can be implemented using
	only passive mechanical components. Part II of this paper is concerned
	with the self-optimization problem, in which both the determination
	of the optimal exercise strategy and the execution of that strategy,
	when the user's biomechanical behavior is unknown, must be considered.},

	fully mechanical systems, in which the motion task was specified
	by behaviors in terms of a velocity field and the closed-loop was

	The proposed control law was derived geometrically and the geometric

	tasks using time invariant desired velocity fields instead of the
	more traditional method of time trajectories and guarantees that
	the closed loop system behave passively with environment power as
	the supply rate. This paper addresses an adaptive generation method

	decentralized PVFC. Of course, this paper is a method of decentralized
	control algorithm for cooperative mobile robot systems handling
	a common object in a coordinated way. The proposed control method
	for cooperative mobile robots in constructed based on the extended
	PVFC in this paper. Moreover the stability and the boundedness are
	ensured using projection algorithm. Finally the effectiveness of
	proposed control method is examined by numerical simulation for

	walking robot, i.e. (i) realization of safe control against human
	brings and the outside environment by utilizing a passive velocity
	field controller (PVFC), and (ii) energy-effective gait design based
	on virtual passive dynamic walking, are studied and a new control
	method is derived based on them. In our previous work, we have given
	a method which satisfied the required properties and examined the
	validity by numerical simulations. In the method a single trajectory
	is realized; however, the walking behavior should be modified and
	adapted by its energy level and initial conditions. Based on the
	observations, we introduce multi-pattern walking using the virtual
	passive gait to realize more natural walking motion. The virtual
	passive gait is shown to require less control input than other methods
	which can generate a limit cycle automatically without any gait
	design, and we combine the virtual passive walk with PVFC to change
	its walking speed easily and effectively.},
